A simple AppWorks service that provides an API for searching for Tweets. We expose a search that will retrieve 50 results at a time, its can be filtered based on whether there was media (images/urls) embdedded. A get by id endpoint is also featured.

It currently provides the following features:

- Full set of REST clients for working with the AppWorks Gateway's deployments API
- Centralised configuration setting management (creation, update, handling changes from the AppWorks Gateway console)
- Handling of service life-cycle events such as 'service installed', 'service upgraded' and 'service uninstalled'
